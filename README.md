# state-transitions-kmeans

This is simple kmeans clustering on MAXI, RXTE/PCA and Swift light curves of low mass black hole X-ray binaries. It is used to systemitcally identify the different 4 spectral states corresponding to hard state, hard-intermdiate state, soft state, soft-intermediate state. The hardness ratio (HR) and intensity of the light cureves is used as input feature. This is clustering implementation was used as part of the work in [Abdulghani et. al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03654).
